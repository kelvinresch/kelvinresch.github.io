                            The name of the game here is high quality orientation data. My IMU measures angular velocities in the
                            directions of roll, pitch, and yaw, which means to get actual position, I need to integrate my values.
                            This can cause some pretty bad drift over time.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            One way I can minimize drift in my orientation data is by using arctangents of my IMU's accelerometer
                            to find absolute position. The issue with this data alone is that it doesn't give me yaw, and it also
                            gets unusably noisy when either the x or y components are near 0. So to compensate in these
                            regions, I can rely more heavily on the gyroscope data.

                            In terms of sensor limitations, the ICM-20948 is a very capable sensor, but it does have a maximum 
                            degrees per second of rotation that it can measure. Similarly, it also has maximum acceleration and
                            magnetic amplitude, but I think the rotational acceleration is going to be the first maximum that I 
                            hit, if I do. According to the 
                            <a href="https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ICM-20948_ArduinoLibrary/blob/main/src/util/ICM_20948_REGISTERS.h" 
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICM-20948's register mappings</a>, the default gyroscope
                            maximum degrees-per-second is +- 1000, which is around 3 revolutions per second. This should be sufficient 
                            for me, and I'll keep in mind not to go over this limit in my testing.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            As I said before, with controls, high-quality data is key. The better your data is, the better the 
                            control. So, I need to be able to collect data from my Artemis, and send it to my PC for analysis.
                            To do so, I used the example code from the ICM-20948 library to set up my DMP. After some basic 
                            functionality testing, I checked that the data I recieved to my PC matched what I expected based on
                            the car's movement.
                        </p>

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Once I was happy with the DMP data that I was collecting, I moved on to retuning my move() 
                            function. This function would take in a value between -255 and 255, and it would make the car rotate
                            at a certain rate. Unfortunately, the static friction to overcome rotation is much higher than the 
                            static friction to overcome rolling forwards and backwards, so I had to retune my move() function. 
                            I did this using a temporary command over ble that would allow me to remotely change my tuning values:

                            This allowed me to rapidly find my offsets and scaling values for my left and right motors so that
                            the robot would spin well in one spot.

                            The PID loop that I wrote worked well to control my robot's yaw, but the integral term was almost zero in
                            my final tune. My final values were Kp = 0.4, Ki = 0.002, and Kd = 0.05. This gave me good damping near
                            my setpoint, and high acceleration when I was far away from my setpoint. The fact that Ki was so small reinforced
                            my theory from Lab 5 that for a semistable system such as a car on flat ground, the integral term is simply
                            unneeded. It only really causes overshoot and phase lag. Again, for the final tune in later labs, I'm going to 
                            go with an optimized PD controller because I think that will result in the best performance for my system.
                            Here's a video of my controller operating:

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Since I'm no longer polling my time-of-flight sensor, my control loop has drastically sped up. Here's a histogram
                            of the number of milliseconds that each control loop takes:

                            As you can see, the time between controls is drastically shortened compared to the 15-25 milliseconds 
                            that a control loop in Lab 5 would take. This is because I optimized my code by removing unneeded low
                            pass filters. I could do this because the data that a got from the DMP was a lot less noisy than the 
                            data from the time-of-flight sensors.

                            This ensures that my control rate is at least 10x faster than the dynamics of my system.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            As previously said, my first goal was to acquire high quality data from the DMP, so I used the example
                            code provided by the library to play with my car's Euler angles and orientation. Once I found that I 
                            had low-noise, high accuracy orientation data that didn't drift over time, I integrated the setup()
                            code into my own bluetooth program, and reported that DMP data to my PC over Bluetooth.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Once I observed this high quality data streaming to my PC, I had the confidence to employ the PID code 
                            from lab 5. This was mostly just copy and paste, since my control code was fairly functional. I was also
                            able to remove a lot of complexity because I no longer needed low pass filters for noisy data and clamping 
                            because I tuned my move() function much better this time around.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            High quality data and good actuators made tuning my PID loop very easy. I used a simply Zeigler Nichols 
                            approach, increasing Kp until I saw a lot of oscillation. This indicated that I was at the edge of stability.
                            I then started with 0.6 Kp, 0.5 Ki, and 0.125 Kd, but this worked poorly. I knew that the integral term was
                            the source of most of my problems because I was in a semistable system, so I reduced my Ki term and increased
                            my Kp term. I knew I was going in the right direction because my controller quicky got much faster and less
                            oscillatory.

                            Here is a plot of my yaw data over time as I kick the car once. You can see that it deflects almost 90 degrees,
                            but it is able to recover quickly with limited overshoot. My setpoint in this example is 0 degrees.
