                            The two DC motors that control the left and right sides of the car are controlled by PWM, so 
                            I needed to make sure that the pins that go to the motor controllers are all PWM-capable. The
                            PWM capable pins on the Apollo3 microcontroller are the pins with the tilde (~) sign. I used
                            pins 9, 11, 12, and 13. Two of these pins went to each motor controller, as well as a ground 
                            line for each.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Batteries have output impedance that can cause drops in voltage when a lot of current is 
                            demanded from them. Since we are driving motors, there will be a large load on the battery
                            hooked up to them, and if the whole system is powered by one battery, then the microcontroller
                            and sensors will all see voltage line fluctuations caused by the motor. In addition, the motor's
                            physical commutator, inductance, and backEMF sends a lot of noise back up the power line, and 
                            this would also negatively affect everything else, so using separate batteries ensures all the 
                            messy signals are isolated to one part of the circuit, and the sensors and sensitive electronics
                            are powered by a different, cleaner voltage line.

                            I connected my power supply to the battery input, my 650 mAh battery to the Artemis, and oscilloscope
                            probe to the motor winding, and set the power supply current compliance to 2 A. Here is what my set

                            Since the battery voltage was at 3.7 V, that's what I set my power supply voltage to. For current compliance,
                            I originally set it to 1 A, but I was hitting the limit and the power supply was throttling my voltage, so 
                            increasing the ceiling to 2 A solved this issue.

                            As mentioned before, the signals that control the motor are pulse-width modulated, and it's important to check
                            that the correct signals are being sent. Also, it's important to check that there is not capacitive or inductive
                            coupling happening with my wires. Here's the code that ran in my test:

                            There is a lot to mount on the car, including signal and power components. To minimize EMI and coupling,
                            I kept loops as small as possible by twisting wires and keeping them short. Also for the sensors, I drilled
                            holes in the car's frame and screwed them. This allows the ToF and IMU sensors to be fixed to the reference
                            frame of the car without moving around at all.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            If I send a 1% duty cycle to motors, they won't turn at all due to static friction. So, I need to surpass a 
                            certain threshold in my duty cycle before the car starts moving at its minimum velocity. This changes depending
                            on battery voltage, but that lower PWM threshold is around 31 and 45 for the right and left motors respectively.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="card-title text-center mb-4">Open Loop Calibration</h2>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            I had to find the lower PWM limit for each motor earlier due to static friction in each drivetrain. In
                            addition to static friction, there is also moving friction, and it's different for each side of the car.
                            So, I also had to add a scaling factor in addition to the offset, and by tuning these scaling factors,
                            I could make my car drive straight in open-loop control.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            I made a function that describes the PWM duty cycle as a function of the throttle with constants for 
                            PWM offset and scaling. The function is:
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            PWM_duty_cycle = (throttle * ((throttle_scaler - throttle_offset) / 255) ) + throttle_offset
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            This makes PWM_duty_cycle a linear function that starts at the point (0, throttle_offset) and
                            ends at (255, throttle_scaler). If you want full beans, throttle_scaler = 255. Here's the code:
                        </p>

                            There is also some code to do saturation in case move() gets called with more that it can take.
                            My right motor is much stronger than my left motor, so I scale my left motor from 255 down to 108.
                            This is quite drastic, so I'm going to test at higher speeds later and see if I can get away with
                            less scaling. If I can, then I'll do something more complex than a two-point calibration to map
                            throttle to PWM duty cycle.
