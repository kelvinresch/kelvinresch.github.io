                            This is a Time-of-Flight sensor. It works by emitting a light pulse and then measuring the time it takes
                            for that pulse to come back. In order to use this sensor, I need to hook it up to my Artemis microcontroller
                            over I2C. According to the Pololu site for the <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/3415" target="_blank" 
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">VL53L1X Time-of-Flight Sensor</a>, the sensor's 7-bit I2C address is 0101001b.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            When I print the I2C address into serial monitor from the sensor, I get 0x29 which is 0101001b in
                            binary, so this makes sense.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Since every sensor defaults to that address, and I want more than one sensor, I need to be able to write 
                            addresses to my sensors. I can do this using Sparkfun's "setI2CAddress()" method. This way, I can create two
                            SFEVL53L1X objects in my code, each with different addresses so that the sensors know who I'm requesting data 
                            from, even if they are on the same data line.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Sensor placement is an important system-engineering-level part of this car's design. I need to make sure I'm
                            building flexibility and functionality into my system so that it meets my design requirements. The main two goals
                            are to make the car to tricks and map out a room. For the tricks, I will want ToF sensors on the front and back
                            since my car will flip over, and for the mapping, I will want ToF sensors on the front and side so that I can
                            follow along the wall of the room. Since I'm doing tricks first, I'll put my sensors on the front and back
                            first. I'll use the longer Qwiic connector wires so that I have more maneuverability.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Putting sensors on the front and back means that I'll have poor sensing while I turn, but this should be okay for
                            flips. If my design requirements become clearer closer to the trick portion of this lab and it turns out that I 
                            want my ToF sensors in a different configuration, I'll move them.
                        </p>

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Here's a schematic of my car's data acquisition system. It uses the I2C multiport to connect multiple sensors to
                            the Artemis at the same time. If I didn't have this multiport system, then I would just daisy-chain the sensors
                            together, which is how I2C was designed to be used, but this is a more convenient system.

                            0d82 or 0x52.

                            According to ST's datasheet and Pololu's technical documentation, this is the default I2C address for this sensor.
                            If I want to use more than one sensor on the same I2C network, then I need to set the address of one of my
                            sensors to something else. To do so, I need to disable one sensor, set the I2C address of the other one over the
                            I2C line, and then enable the other sensor. This way, one of them will be left untouched, and the other one will
                            have the new address, allowing me to use both of them on the same network.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Using the I2C protocol, I can retrieve data from the sensor. I can also use getDistanceMode() to read the 
                            distance mode that's default with Adafruit's library. According to the header file, 2 corresponds to
                            "long distance mode", so I can measure up to 4m with this sensor right now, although my error is a little
                            higher than it could be. The tradeoff between the different modes is between maximum distance and 
                            accuracy, so for fine sensing purposes, short-distance mode would be better. This would be for like the
                            side sensor of the car while it maps the room. The long-distance sensor would be better for high-speed
                            navigation like when it's doing stunts.

                            100 mm to 2500 mm. Then, I took the average and variance of those measurements to collect my
                            reliability data for the ToF sensor. This test was conducted on long-distance mode.

                            Based on the graph, the sensor is fairly accurate up until around 1.5 meters. It undershoots a tiny bit,
                            but this undershoot is fairly constant. Also, the variance in the measurement is very low. Past 1.5
                            meters, the sensor undershoots more, and the variance of the measurement increases. You can see this
                            in the raw data as noise after the ~350th sample.

                            Although the sensor is supposed to work up until 4 meters in long-distance mode, I was only able to get
                            up to about 2.5 meters before the sensor's noise rendered it unusable. According to the 
                            <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/3415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                            Pololu Website</a>, the sensor doesn't work that well in long-distance mode with background light,
                            so I believe this was the cause. The hallway that I was testing in had windows and artificial lighting,
                            which probably added noise to the sensor's readings.

                            As mentioned before, the cardboard material, the sensor has a tendency to undershoot its readings,
                            especially at longer range. Here is a plot of sensor error as a function of distance in millimeteres.
                            Notice how the error scales linearly with distance, causing the error measurement to remain fairly
                            stable. At close ranges, the error jumps up significantly. This is possibly due to the fact that 
                            this data was taken in long-distance mode. Perhaps short-distance mode has less error.

                            In long-distance mode, the error spikes in the negative direction at around 300 mm. In short-distance
                            mode, the error spikes around 100 mm, so short-range mode definitely retains good measurement for longer.
                            I think for the wall-stop thing I'm going to use short-range mode for the high data quality.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            The variance for the ToF sensor is fairly low when the measurement is not at the far limit of the 
                            sensor's ability, so usually the sample-to-sample repeatability for each measurement is quite good.
                            As for the sensor's repeatability between tests, the datasheet said that the sensor works better at
                            lower light levels, so the sensor's error is probably also a function of how much background light
                            there is. I'm guessing the background light acts as a noise floor for the sensor.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            I know that the sensor gives me data pretty slowly, but I'm not sure about the variance. Here's a 
                            plot of the time between sensor readings:
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            According to the data, 89% of the samples are 50-60 ms apart, and 11% of the samples have a large amount 
                            of time elapse between each reading. The lags last between 150-750 ms. They also seem quantized at 150, 250,
                            350, 450... ms, which is weird to me. This could cause control issues in the future.
