                    <p class="card-text">
                        The purpose of this class was to built a robotic,
                        autonomous car that could navigate its
                        surroundings. This required us to contend with
                        various sensors, non-linearities, feedback
                        control, and embedded programming. The goal of
                        this lab was to implement navigation through
                        a room with our car. We started with building the
                        robot's hardware: sensors, motors, and wiring.
                        Then, we implemented the software: PID loops to
                        control orientation and linear position, a Kalman
                        Filter to merge sensor data, and Bayes filtering
                        to localize the robot in a room. Finally, it's
                        time to put all of this together and let the robot
                        navigate itself through the room.
                    </p>
                    <h1 class="card-title text-center mb-4">Key Parts</h1>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The system in composed of three main parts:
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        State machine to step through the different phases of
                        the robot's movement, angular PID control to
                        rotate the robot to a setpoint, and linear PID control
                        to move the robot precise distances.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        For the PID control, I wrote a small library to reduce
                        the spaghetti code that I wrote in previous labs.
                        This consisted of a PID class that would be initialized
                        with control parameters, and a method to
                        compute the control signal. The class also has a method
                        to reset the internal state of the PID controller.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Here's the core method of the PID class. It takes the
                        setpoint, sensor, and time as inputs, and returns
                        the control signal. I included clamping on the integral
                        term to prevent windup, and I also included
                        a lowpass filter on the derivative term to reduce noise.
                        The low pass filter is implemented as a simple
                        first order filter, and the cutoff frequency is adjustable
                        based on the initalization of the PID class..

                    <h1 class="card-title text-center mb-4">Challenges</h1>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The biggest challenge I faced in this lab was hardware and spaghettification.
                        I spent some time in the beginning of the semester to build a high quality robot, and
                        everything held up very well up until this lab. For some reason, but motor controllers
                        became unresponsive, and I had to use Rachel Arena's car to complete the lab.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The other challenge I faced in this lab was spaghetti code. Up until this point, everything
                        I wrote was in one big file, and much of my code approached 1500 lines. This made the code
                        difficult to read and maintain, especially because there were sections that were repeated.
                        One of the things I did to reduce the spaghetti code was to write a PID class that would
                        handle the PID control for me. This is because PID control is used in two places in this
                        program, but the execution is the exact same. It just has different parameters, which
                        makes it a perfect fit for object-oriented programming.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Writing the PID class was a good first step, but I still had a lot of code that was repeated
                        due to the state machine. This ended up making my file over 1000 lines long, but it was still
                        more readable because the code was organized into blocks that were easy to follow. I think
                        the next step for me is to write a state machine class that would handle the state machine
                        logic, to offboard the state machine logic from the Artemis to my PC. This would also increase
                        flexibility, as the robot would not need to be reflashed to change the state machine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        One other challenge I faced was compile time. Compilation took multiple minutes for me each
                        time,
                        which slowed down my development process. I think this is because of the global libraries
                        including
                        ArduinoBLE, ICM20948, and SparkFun_VL53L1X. I tried creating a separate c file that would import
                        the
                        libraries in a way that would cache the compiled code so that they don't have to get recompiled
                        each
                        time, but I couldn't get it to work. The Artemis compiler is apparently known to be heavy, and I
                        think
                        in future robotics projects, I will try to use a different microcontroller that has a faster
                        compiler.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Since this lab involved a lot of "putting it all together", I wanted to make sure that the
                        elements that I was putting together already worked well in isolation. I started with the
                        angular PID controller, and tested it with setpoints from the original Lab 6, as well as
                        Lab 9.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Then, I moved on to the linear PID controller, and tested it with setpoints from Lab 5. In
                        both controllers, I switched to using the PID class that I wrote, and I was able to get
                        the robot to rotate and move in a straight line even better than before. I think this is
                        because the PID class is more robust than the code I wrote in previous labs, and it also
                        has more finely tuned parameters. Increasing the lowpass filter on the derivative term
                        helped a lot with noise, and I think the integral term is more stable now too because I
                        added the dt term to the sum.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The only thing I'd do differently in hindsight is to offload the state machine logic
                        to my PC. I think this would have made the code a lot cleaner, and it would have also
                        made it easier to change the state machine without having to reflash the robot. Especially
                        because the compilation time is so long, I think it would have been worth it to do this.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The core decision I made in this lab was to use a state machine to control the robot's
                        navigation through the space. The alternative would have been to use the Bayesian filter to
                        localize the robot, and then give it delta_angle_1, delta_distance, and delta_angle_2
                        setpoints to allow it to navigate through the space. If my robot had not broken, I think I would
                        have been able to do this, but I think the state machine is a good alternative considering the
                        circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        If I were to implement the Bayesian filter, I would have created three commands: CHANGE_ANGLE,
                        LINEAR_MOVE, and SAMPLE_DISTANCE. The CHANGE_ANGLE command would take in a set delta_angle, and
                        move the robot accordingly. It would do this by sampling the DMP yaw angle at the beginning of
                        command call, adding the setpoint delta to that, and then using the PID controller to
                        rotate the robot to that angle. The LINEAR_MOVE command would working in a similar fashion, by
                        measuring the current distance to the wall, and then setting the setpoint to that distance plus
                        the delta_distance. Finally, SAMPLE_DISTANCE would just take a few samples of the ToF sensors,
                        and
                        return that single value to the PC.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The alternative to this architecture would be to have a
                        MOVE command that takes care of delta_angle_1,
                        delta_distance, and delta_angle_2 all at once, and a
                        GET_OBSERVATION command that works similar to
                        Lab 9's mapping command, and return that data for the
                        localization. This would be a marginally easier
                        to implement on the PC side, but it would make the Artemis
                        code more complicated and more spaghetti-like
                        because of the multiple control states. Especially since flashing
                        the Artemis takes a long time, I would want to make the embedded-side
                        code as simple as possible. Also, writing a simple method to replace
                        loc.get_observation_data() and traj.execute_time_step() would not be
                        too difficult.
                    </p>
                    <h1 class="card-title text-center mb-4">Conclusion</h1>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Overall, I'm quite happy with how this lab turned out. I think it a fair job
                        integrating all of the different parts of earlier labs in this class, and I
                        learned a lot about the importance of modularity and code organization, especially
                        in integration projects like this. I think the biggest takeaway for me is that
                        I need to work better around system weaknesses, such as the long compilation time.
                        Putting the state machine on the microcontroller was not a wise idea, and I had
                        enough information when starting this lab to know that I should have put it on the PC.
                        Regardless, I think the robot turned out well, and I'm happy with how it performed.
