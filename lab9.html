                            This flip is an exercise in open loop control. I have to get my robot to flip over, and then land 
                            on its wheels. To do this, I need to get my robot to rotate 180 degrees in the air. This is a lot 
                            of angular momentum, and I need to build it up by accelerating quickly. In addition, I need a lot 
                            of grip on my wheels to transfer torque into the ground. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            To do this, I applied double-sided 3M tape to my front two wheels. I decided that it wasn't worth it to
                            put tape on all four wheels because on deceleration, only the front two wheels are going to be
                            pushing against the ground.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            After I first added the tape, the car became completely stuck to the ground. It turns out that 3M makes
                            some really good tape. I added a video of this behavior at the end of the lab report, in the bloopers
                            section. After peeling my car off the ground, I rolled it around carefully to collect some
                            dust on the tires so that they would be the right amount of stickiness to accelerate, decelerate, and flip.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            In addition, to make flipping easier, I also moved the center of gravity of my car up and to the front
                            of the car by taping a handful of M10 screws to the chassis. This made the car much easier to flip because
                            the mass of the screws would pull the car forward and over as it decelerated.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            I set up a test rig to test my flip similar to the one that was available in the hallway outside of the fast Robots
                            lab. I used a line in the floor to mark my starting point, and a rectangular pad of duct tape as the traction pad,
                            although this ended up not being very necessary to flip. I also put a large cardboard box at the end of the traction
                            pad so that the ToF sensor would be able to sense the "wall."

                            The distance between the traction pad and the starting line of the test was 80 inches, or a little over two meters.

                            Here's my ToF sensor recording data as I decelerate into the flip. The ToF data becomes unintelligible after
                            this because the car is upside down, and the ToF sensor is no longer able to see the wall.

                            Next to the ToF data is the throttle input to the motor. I worked with some other students to test different
                            strategies for flipping, and I found that the easiest way to flip was to accelerate at full throttle, 
                            and then decelerate at full throttle. I also experimented with a brief stop just after the flip so that
                            the car wouldn't try accelerating backwards while it was still bouncing around after the flip. This 
                            increased the consistency of the flips significantly.
