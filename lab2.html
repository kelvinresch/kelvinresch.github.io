                            I have set up my IMU to communicate with the Artemis over I2C, which requires each peripheral to have an address.
                            The IMU has a default I2C address of 0bxxxxxx1, and if I short the ADR jumper pads on the back of the IMU, I can set the I2C 
                            address to be 0bxxxxxx0. Basically, this determines what the last bit of the IMU's I2C address is. According to 
                            <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-9dof-imu-breakout-icm-20948-qwiic.html" target="_blank" 
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Sparkfun's website</a>, the full I2C address is 0x69 normally, and 0x68 with 
                            the jumper, which is consistent with AD0_val's behavior.

                            The acceleration data is reported in units of milli-g. When I hold the accelerometer flat against the
                            table, the x and y axes read zero acceleration, and the z-axis reads 1000 milli-g of acceleration, which
                            is consistent with what I expect, as the acceleration of gravity is acting on the MEMS sensor.

                            When I rotate the IMU, the x and y axes change, and the z-axis decreases. If I put the IMU on its side,
                            the y-axis goes to 1000 and the other axes go to 0. This means that the y-axis of the IMU is pointing
                            downwards (the direction of gravity's acceleration).

                            is consistent with expectations.

                            One issue with gryoscope data is that it has drift. The IMU chip reports angular velocity in degrees per second,
                            and I'm integrating that over time to get the angle. The data has low noise but high drift due to this integral. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            To prevent this drift, I can use atan2() with the accelerometer data to report a driftless measurement of pitch and roll.
                            This idea takes advantage of that fact that on Earth, we constantly have an acceleration vector of length 1 g pointing downwards.
                            By evaluating the components of the gravity vector along the x and y axes, we can get an absolute measurement of pitch and yaw.
                            Unfortunately, since the yaw axis points along the gravity vector, we cannot determine yaw with this method.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            You can see that the roll data from both the accelerometer and gyroscope agree at 90 degrees. However, if I move the 
                            IMU around, the gyroscope will eventually diverge from the accelerometer data.

                            The drawback of using the accelerometer to measure pitch and roll is that noise increases severely near 90 degrees. 
                            This is a result of atan2 being poorly conditioned around accel_z = 0. If I expect the car to need pitch and roll measurements
                            near 90 degrees, I would not use this data in that operating condition. You can see in the below picture how 
                            noisy pitch_a gets here.

                            we can measure roll and pitch with a separate method from the gyroscope. The accelerometer data is driftless,

                            The chip itself is already set to a low-noise mode, so that also explains why the data is quite stable.

                            It more modular and easier to add and remove things when you store separate arrays in the short run.
                            In the long run, you could make one large array and have your "send to PC" function smartly load
                            data based on some enumeration or something, but that's just a quality of life upgrade for the 
                            programmer, not an optimization for runtime. Storing data in multiple or one big array also takes up
                            the same amount of memory. So, for the ease of development, I believe that storing accelerometer and 
                            gyroscope data in separate arrays is the better choice.

                            floats instead of strings, because strings are really memory-inefficient for storing numbers. A float
                            with 5 digits and a period takes 24 bytes to store, as opposed to four bytes for the float and one byte
                            perhaps for some null character. Most of the math that I do on this microcontroller doesn't need double.
                            In fact, I think I don't even need floats and could get away with fixed-point arithmetic. So, as long 
                            as it's not Strings or doubles, I'm fine with either data type between floats and ints.

                            To collect 5 seconds worth of data, all I need to do is increase my array size and flag my data collection
                            loop to stop after 5 seconds. The issue I ran into here is maintaining a stable connection over such a long
                            period of time. At least that's what I think it is. Anyway, here's some data for 5 seconds. It's about 1600
                            data points and there are another four registers for all pitch data that I haven't plotted.

                            I spent some time playing with the RC car and got it to do a few flips. With more battery,
                            I think you could flip just by decelerating hard at high speed, but I did it against some walls.
