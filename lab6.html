                            As with the previous lab, I plan to have two separate system states: Collecting Data and Transmitting 
                            Data. In the first state I also have my control loop. This way, I first collect data while controlling my car,
                            then I stop my car and transmit the data to my laptop for analysis.

                            To maximize my data rates, I fill up my characteristic array full of data before sending. I've seen some projects
                            projects upload one data sample per characteristic array, but I tested in lab 1 that I can only send characteristic
                            arrays at around 42 Hz, which makes my payload rate my limiting factor. Therefore, if I can make my payloads larger,
                            I can send data faster.

                            After pulling a few hundred data points from the ToF sensor, I plotted the time between samples, and found that 
                            the average sampling rate is around 40 Hz, and it's consistent. I'm happy running my control loop at this rate.
                            I think that sometimes, this rate is limited by compute efficiency, not the sampling rate of the sensor, so if I
                            optimize my code, then I can probably bring in the upper limit of sample periods from 30 ms down to around 20 ms.

                            It's just a happy coincidence though that my PID control loop is running around the same speed as my sensor speed.
                            In the future, I'll add more processing-heavy algorithms and also optimize my code heavily so that my control loop
                            can be super fast, so I'll want to decouple these two rates from each other.

                            Since I'm going to control at a faster rate than I can get data from my ToF sensor, I'm going to need to extrapolate
                            my data. To do so, I'm going to use the slope of my ToF data, and project that slope from my most recent data point 
                            to get an estimate of where I am. Unfortunately, my ToF sensor data is really noisy, and differentiating a noisy
                            signal makes it garbage. So I put a first-order LPF on the differential input, and also put more filtering on the output.

                            The fact that my control loop is running 3-4x faster than my data acquisition time means that extrapolation can make
                            a significant difference in the quality of my control here. My P controller might be a little more jerky without good
                            extrapolation. I would also build up my integral term faster because I'm collecting more error.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            For feedback control, I started with a simple P controller. This kind of worked, but I felt it was too slow, so I decided
                            to add an integral term. Unfortunately, after tuning for a while, my car kept overshooting even as I turned k_i smaller
                            and smaller. Eventually it was basically zero (0.00002), so I decided to try adding a derivative term to cancel out the
                            integral windup. This caused the car to get really jerky, and I kept on getting weird spikes in the billions, which is
                            really bad. I'm sure this was a fixable problem, but the other solution was to just go with a P controller again and make it
                            work rather than have an "optimized" system that doesn't work. So, I went with a P controller and used a really low saturation
                            value for my control signal so that I wouldn't overshoot.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            This worked really well. In hindsight, it was pretty dumb to use a PI controller here since I don't have any forces acting
                            on my car. It's perfectly semi-stable, so I really don't need the integral. I PD controller might work well here, if I can
                            get the derivative portion to stop spazzing out. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            I think later on I'll try to get a PD controller tuned to hell and not worry about the integral term. It would be cool if I
                            could get the car's wheels to turn backwards while slowing down. At the end of the day, I made the car work with 
                            kp = 0.05, ki = 0.0, and kd = 0.0.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            I think the range of the sensor really doesn't matter much here. When the car is over 1.3m away, the control signal is probably
                            saturated anyways, so it really doesn't matter if you're 1.5 m or 2 m away from the wall, you're just going to accelerate at the
                            wall anyways. In terms of precision, short range mode might help marginally here, but I still don't think it's that big of a deal
                            until you get a pretty aggressive derivative term.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            As for sampling time, my ToF sensor runs at around 40-50 Hz, and my control loop is running at around 100-150 Hz. This
                            is why extrapolation of my ToF sensor data is important.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="card-title text-center mb-4">The road to feedback control</h2>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            I started this lab in a really dumb way. I thought that it'd be cool to not only extrapolate data, but use a complementary
                            filter to combine IMU data with ToF data. This was a terrible idea because my IMU gave me so much drift that I thought it
                            was an issue with how I was calculating my values. So I was "debugging" an intrinsic problem with my system for like six hours.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            After realizing my mistake, accepting failure, and deleting all my code, attempt 2 was a little smoother. Extrapolating the pure
                            ToF sensor data went pretty smoothly, although I needed to use a much stronger LPF than I anticipated. I guess this makes sense 
                            because you're differentiating a noisy signal, and that usually gives you garbage, but I didn't internalize the extent of that at 
                            first.

                            data[n-1] - data[n-2]. The other two LPFs were cascaded on each other on the differential output. This gave me a 
                            second-order LPF that worked really well to prevent spikes in the raw data from affecting my extrapolation.

                            I made sure that my ToF sensor was really high quality because I knew from experience that feedback control tuning gets
                            really easy if you have good data and good state estimation. So from here, things went pretty smoothly.

                            As mentioned before, I started with a P controller but was unhappy with its slow performance. So I moved on to a PI controller,
                            which gave me overshoot, and then I added a D term to compensate for the overshoot. This didn't work because I got a ton of 
                            noise on my D term, so I spent some time thinking and realized that this system doesn't even need an I term at all. This is 
                            because there are no constant forces like gravity here. The entire car's state space is semi-stable, so an I term just adds 
                            either oscillation or overshoot. Either way it's eating up my phase margin. I've also tuned my car's movement so that there's
                            no "threshold" level of throttle for the car to move. move(255) is really fast and move(1) is really slow, but the car is only
                            still when I write move(0).

                            Anyways, by switching back to a P controller, the system worked really well and the car stopped right at the 12 inch mark
                            from the wall, which is great. Here's a video of that happening:

                            And here's a graph of the position from the wall over time. You can see that it spends most of its time in saturation,
                            and it has a small overshoot due to the momentum of the car as it approaches the setpoint:

                            You can also see more definitely that the car spends most of its time in saturation by looking directly at the control
                            input to the motors. Here's a graph of the PWM amplitude over time:

                        <p class="card-text">
                            If we put the two graphs together, you can see how the control signal saturates in large error and how it reacts to 
                            in the actual position as you overshoot and come into the steady-state position:

                            Overall, I learned from this lab the importance of good data in control systems. It's an information problem, so if you
                            have bad info, you'll have bad control. Also, I learned the simpler is better, and that it's worth it to build systems
                            step-by-step instead of all at once, especially for algorithm-based programming like this. I'm also glad I put effort
                            into making my car robust, because I didn't have to worry about it failing at all this lab. I'm looking forward to 
                            implementing better state estimation techniques like Kalman filtering in future labs and using that to make better
                            control systems.
